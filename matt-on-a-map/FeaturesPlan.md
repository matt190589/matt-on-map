//Look for an API with any the object data required or create my own
//Add validation to the user input ✅
//Input validation with regex ✅
//Input validation to stop blank guesses
//Need to implement testing for this function
//Replace the alert with more appropriate pop up
//Implement local storage to allow users records to be recorded ✅

//Overhaul the CSS layout when thee final logic is complete
//Rebuild the layout

//Possible pop out cards for clues 2 & 3 -Modals

//Deploy on netlify or Vercel

//Update to plan 13.03

// Find out to clear local storage at midnight everyday
//Done but needs tested on deployment

//Rearrange the clue order

//Create a backend to store all the data
